From here, you'll be taken through the entire setup process, from taking it out of the Toolbox to publishing the game. Before pulling in the model, make sure your game has a lobby, along with nothing that may interfere with the holo, such as leaderstats. Part 1: Pulling in Model To pull in the CC Holo model, open the Toolbox. This is located in the View tab in Studio. Next, go to the Inventory tab. Look for the CC Holo item, and click it. Once you do, you may need to give Studio a minute to bring in everything. It may freeze, but it shouldn't crash. After everything is loaded, and you can move around, give the README script a look through. Once you have, drag each model in it to the Service with the same name. Getting the Teams Service If you don't already have the Teams service, you can get it by going to the Model tab and selecting the highlighted button. Select Teams, then click Insert Part 2: Extracting the Model After each model is in the correct service, select each one and press CTRL+U to ungroup it. Once everything is ungrouped, it should appear as shown in these screenshots.

Permissions Issues Issues that pertain to permissions of CC Holo I can't see the controls button Solution : Check to make sure your Group ID and Minimum Rank Settings are properly configured, as this can lead to the inability to use the controls. An HR pressed a button and got kicked Solution : Have that user completely leave the game, rather than use something like a rejoin command or button. Alternate Solution : Disable the Security Check option UI Issues Issues that pertain to the UI of CC Holo Buttons are appearing where they shouldn't Solution : This is most likely a UI bug, so please report it in the comments of the Bug Reports card on the Trello page. I tried loading a map without hitting Clear Solution : Maps won't load if one is already active, so make sure you hit Clear before loading a different one. If a map isn't loaded, and trying to load one isn't doing anything, please report it in the comments of the Bug Reports card on the Trello page. Tools are showing given, but I don't have them Solution : Check to make sure someone didn't remove them from you (usually via admin), and that you didn't drop it. If others are experiencing the same issue, and nothing happened that would cause the loss of tools, please report it in the comments of the Bug Reports card on the Trello page.
